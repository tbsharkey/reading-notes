## JavaScript Canvas

### What does the <canvas> allow a developer to achieve?

Canvas allows developers to achieve dynamic rendering of graphics, animations, and interactive content within web pages. Applications include data visualizations, interactive games, image manipulation, and animations.

### What is the importance of the closing `</canvas> tag?
Semantically closing the canvas tag is the right thing to do. This will also prevent possible browser rendering issues. Code validators and linters will also not have issues with a properly closed tag.

### Explain what the getContext() method does.
The getContext() element is used to obtain a rendering context which is an object that provides methods and properties necessary for drawing graphics on the canvas. The type of rendering can be specified through this element. 

## Chart.js Documentation

```
<script src="path/to/your/downloaded/chartjs/chart.min.js"></script>
<canvas id="myChart"></canvas>

```

### List 3 different Chart types you can create using Chart.js.
Three types of charts that Chart.js can create are doughnut charts, radar charts, and polar area charts. 

## Create Stunning Animated Charts with Chart.js

### What are some advantages to displaying data via a chart over a table?
Visual appeal, faster interpretation, simplified comparisons, and effective communication are some advantages that a chart has over a table. 

### How could Chart.js aid your previously created applications visually?
In a recent project I had a fairly large table displaying hourly data. A chart with a more simple data labels could have effectively presented the data in a way that it would have been easy to read at a glance.

## Things I want to know more about
I'd like to see more of Chart.Js in use.
