## Local Storage and How to Use it on Websites

### Why would a developer use local storage for a web application?
Local storage allows data to be cached reducing reloading times for a webpage. It offer more flexibility than cookies and does not need to transmit to a server. 

### What information should not be stored in local storage?
Personal information, credit card numbers, and passwords should not be stored in local storage. 

### Local storage can store what type of data? How would you convert it to that type before storing?
Local storage stores data in key value pairs that are comprised of strings. Depending on the language, there are various methods that can be called on an item to convert it to a strong. In JavaScript this would be .toString().

## Things I want to know more about
I had no idea local storage existed in the way that it does. I knew that browsers could take up a lot of system resources but how it's utilized is new to me. I have a much better understanding of cookies and their limitations. I want to know more about programming in regards to local storage.
