## Troubleshooting JavaScript

### Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.
Syntax errors are spelling errors in the code that cause it to not run at all. Logic errors are where the syntax is correct but the code is not implemented corrected. The latter are more difficult to fix than the former. 

### List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them. 
I've had both syntax and logic errors in my recent labs. It's hard to say which has been more common but I have often had issues with either improper variable or function names in addition to not using camel case properly. 

### How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?
It is most efficient to write code that doesn't produce errors but this is likely an impossible task. I think maintaining attention to detail will probably eliminate more instances of syntax errors though. Being able to read and debug errors is something that I'm still building up to.

## The JavaScript Debugger

### How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?
The JavaScript debugger is a part of a developer tool that allows anyone to look at the code of a website. Since JavaScript is run in the background and isn't normally visible, it allows someone to look at the end results of code that either has or is currently executing. Furthermore, a developer can look at the existing code and either manipulate what's currently there or inject new code to test its functionality. 

### Define what a breakpoint is.
A breakpoint is a point in a program's execution where it stops or pauses so a developer can inspect the program's state. It's a debugging tool used to find errors. A breakpoint can be set at any point in the code where it stops and then the state of the code can be evaluated. 

### What is the call stack?
A call stack is a data structure that is used by computer programs to keep track of the position of execution within the program. It works as a stack of function calls that have been made by the program. When a function is called it's added to the top of the call stack. As it executes the control returns to the function that called it.

## Things I want to know more about
I'd like to learn a lot more about call stacks and actually lean how to implement them.
