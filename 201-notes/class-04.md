## CSS Layout

### What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?
Block level elements take up the full width of the container by default and create a new line after the element. Inline elements on the other hand exist inside of block level elements and don't take up as much width. They typically use attributes to modify the block level element. 

### ___ positioning is the default for every html element.

### What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?
The difference is in how they are positioned relative to the viewport. In absolute positioning the element is positioned in relation to its ancestor whereas foxed positioning is relative to the viewport allowing an element to be fixed while the page is scrolled. Fixed positioning also causes an element to remain in the viewport while absolute may cause its element to move.

## Things I want to know more about
I'm wanting to dive more into JavaScript functions as I have experience working with them in Ruby. There are many similarities so I will need some practice and remedial drills to further instill this knowledge.
