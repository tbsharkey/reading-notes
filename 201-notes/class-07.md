## Domain Modeling

### Explain why we need domain modeling.
Domain modelising is creating a conceptual model to solve a specific problem. The model will outline the various components, all the included attributes, and limitations. Domain modeling clarifies requirements, reduces misunderstandings, improves design, and facilitates testing.

### HTML Table Basics

### Why should tables not be used for page layouts?
Tables are meant to be uysed for tabular data. Using them for layout causes issues with accessibility, producing to many tags, and not being automaticaly respsonsive. 

### List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML <table>.
<thead>- Used to group table rows in column headers.
<tbody>- The tbody contains the main data rows.
<tfooter>- The tfooter ise used for summary information such as totals or averages.

## Introducing Constructors

### What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?
A constructor is a function that used to create and initialize objects. It allows ability to encapsualte properties and methods within an object. Constructors are reusable and can create multiple objects. Futhermore, constructors provide a simple way to initializatize objects.

### How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?
In an object literal 'this' refers to the the object that is being defined. When used in a constructor 'this' referes to a new object that is being created.

## Object Prototypes Using A Constructor

### Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.
I worked for a railroad that had several different departments that specialized in a different function of a business. In this case the company would be the prototype and the departments would resemeble a child object that inhereits rules and procedures from the parent. A department can be created utilizing the common rules and procedures while having its own uniqiue methods to accomplish its tasks. 

## Things I want to know more about.
I'd like more practice with creating and manipulating objects.
