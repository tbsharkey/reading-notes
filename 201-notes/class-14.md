## CSS Transforms

### What does a CSS transform allow the developer to do to an element?
A transform allows the developer to change the appearance and postion of an element in a 2d or 3d space. It can be used to rotate, scale, skew, and translate.

### Provide an example of a transform and how you could see that being used on a website.
```
.my-element {
  transform: rotate(45deg);
}
```
This declaration rotates an element by a specified amount of degrees.

## CSS Transitions & Animations

### What does a CSS transition allow the developer to do to an element?
A transistion allows an element to change gradually in a smoother way without having to use JavaScript. The duration of the timing can be set in CSS.

### How does a CSS animation differ from a CSS transition?
Transitions allow for the smooth tranistion of an element between two states. The transition occurs over a specified duratation and can be triggered by a change in state of the element such as a hover or a clock. Animations on the other hand allow for more complex and continuous movement and changes in an element's properties over time.
