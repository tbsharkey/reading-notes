## Video and Audio Content

### Explain how the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000s.
Broadband has increased dramatically since the early 2000's allowing richer multimedia experiences to be delivered. Newer compression algorithms have allowed for better quality multimedia in lower files sizes. The introduction of HTML5 has allowed web browsers to natively support audio and video elements. 

### Describe the use of the src and controls attributes in the <video> element.
The src attribute specifies the source url of the video file to be played. This can be an absolute or relative path. The controls attribute is a boolean attribute that will either display browser video controls or not. This include play/pause buttons.

### Why is it important to have fallback content inside the <video> element?
Fallback content inside the video element ensures that multimedia content remains accessible and usable in scenarios where the video cannot be played. Some older browsers don't support the video attribute. The fallback content will allow a different type of media displayed in the event the first one doesn't work.

### Write a very short story where <audio> and <video> are characters.
In the magical land of Webville, two inseparable friends, Audio and Video, lived side by side, bringing joy and entertainment to the people. Audio filled the air with sweet melodies, podcasts, and informative news, while Video captivated hearts and minds with vivid images and dazzling colors. One day, an evil sorcerer named Obsolete came to Webville, casting a spell to make Audio and Video's talents disappear, hoping to leave the townspeople without their cherished sources of entertainment and knowledge. Realizing they had to unite their powers to overcome Obsolete's malicious intent, Audio and Video combined their strengths, creating a harmonious blend of visual and auditory experiences, giving birth to a powerful force known as Multimedia. Together, they fought against Obsolete's spell, filling Webville with a chorus of synchronized music and visuals that broke the enchantment. The townspeople rejoiced as their beloved sources of joy and wisdom returned, now more powerful and engaging than ever before, while Obsolete retreated to the shadows, vowing to find another way to strikeâ€”but Audio, Video, and the power of Multimedia would always stand ready to defend their beloved town of Webville.

## A complete Guide to Grid

### How does Grid layout differ from Flex?
Grid is a two dimensional layout instead of a one dimensional that is flexbox. Grid allows more control over the alignment of content in both dimensions. Grid is better suited for complex  multi-dimensional layouts, while flexbox is better suited for simpler, one-dimensional layouts.

### Grid container, grid item, and grid line are a few important terms to understand when using Grid. Please describe these terms in a few sentences.
A grid container is an element that contains a grid and all direct children of a grid container become grid items. A grid item is an element that's a direct child of a grid container and is placed in the grid. Grid items can span one or more rows and columns of the grid. Grid lines are the horizontal and vertical lines that form the grid. They separate the grid into rows and columns and are numbered starting from 1.

## Responsive Images

### Besides making a site visually appealing across different screen sizes, why should developers make images responsive?
Making images responsive can result in faster loading timers, improved accessibility, reduced bandwidth usage and better SEO.

### Define the following <img> attributes srcset and sizes. Write an example of how they are used.
The attribute srcset allows multiple versions of an image at different sizes or resolutions letting the browser choose the most appropriate version based on the user's device and screen size. The sizes attribute specifies the width of the images as it will be displayed on the page and is used to help the browser determine which image source to use from the srcset attribute. 

### How is srcset more helpful for responsive images than CSS or JavaScript?
The srcset attribute is a native HTML feature that's designed specifically for serving responsive images, and has several advantages over using CSS or JavaScript to handle responsive images.
