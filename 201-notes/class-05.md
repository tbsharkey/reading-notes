## HTML Media

### What is a real world use case for the alt attribute being used in a website?
An alt is important for vision impaired readers or to have a backup in case an image doesn't load.

Use the alt tag to describe images, use meaningful file names that describe the content, use accessible image formats, and consider color contrast.

### Describe the difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element, pretend you are talking to someone with no technical knowledge.
The foreground color is also known as the text color. Basically it's the colors of all text on a part of a webpage. The backroung color covers everything around text. So a blank page with a white background would appear empty and if a black foreground was applied then the webpage would display back text with everything else being white. 
### Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character?
I would at minumum add a background color to give the website some visual appeal compared to a blank white one. Finding complementary colors will highlight certain parts of the page to stand out more than others.

Compatability for browers is the most important thing to consider for fonts but other considerations should be readability and loading time of external fonts.

Font-size, font-weight, and font-stlye are all properties that modify text within an attribute.
