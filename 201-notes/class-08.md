## Learn CSS

### Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.
Flexbox takes in content on one dimension and lays it out between two axes. These are the main and the cross axes.

### Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.
Flexbox has one main axis and one cross axis. The main axis is where all the items are laid out in a vertical or horizontal manner. The cross axis is perpendicular to the main axis. 

### How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?
Items that are laid out in a column instead of row can have a negative impact on screen readers. Using justify-content: center can make a webpage difficult to navigate for some users. Flex-wrap can cause items wrap to a new line making the content unreadable. 

## CSS Layout-Flexbox

### What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?
Float was intended to wrap text around images whereas Flexbox alows more options to align and distribute items in a container. Flexbox allows greater control over spacing and works well with responsive design.

### How does this topic connect with your long term goals?
I want to write clean and effiecient code. I also want to spend less time on smaller parts of a project. Flexbox is another tool to have to do this. 

## Things I want to know more about
I'd like to learn more about the use cases between flex box and CSS grid. While I've used the former I never understood when it would be a better case to use the latter.
