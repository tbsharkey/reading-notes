Internal CSS- A style section is added to the head of the document containing all relevant CSS.
External stylesheet- An external stylesheet containing all CSS is linked through the head.

### Why should we avoid using inline styles?
Inline styles must be duplicated often and decrease the readability of the code. 

## Review the block of code below and answer the following questions:
